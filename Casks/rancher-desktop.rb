  caveats <<~EOS
    Docker Desktop cannot be run at the same time Rancher Desktop.
    Before starting one, be sure to stop the other first.
    See https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/faq/

    Additionally, because Rancher Desktop (unlike Docker Desktop) allows
    manual management of Supporting Utilities, these utilities won't be
    removed by Homebrew during cask uninstall:

    /usr/local/bin/docker
    /usr/local/bin/helm
    /usr/local/bin/kubectl
    /usr/local/bin/nerdctl

    So, please make sure to unlink them in Rancher Desktop UI beforehand.
